<p>Indicate how you will encode a sample puzzle as PHP. Remember, that you need to encode not only how the puzzle will appear to the user, but the solution as well.</p>

We will incode a puzzle as an Array of Arrays that store Cell classes. Each cell class will know both the solution and whether to show that cell's number at the start of the puzzle.
